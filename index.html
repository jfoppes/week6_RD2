            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I started my love of cooking and baking at a very early age. My mother was a stay at home mother as many women were back in the 1970's. She was always baking something delicious for desert, and I loved to watch her and help her in her kitchen. I have many great memories of my Grandmother baking wonderful pies for holiday's and an assortment of cakes and cookies as well. </p>
            <p>I have always considered baking as a fun and relaxing thing to do, and I have always been the one to bake everything for church bake sales and just as gifts for friends and family . Since moving downstate and seeing all the quaint little businesses people have started around this area, as well, as a need for GREAT pies and cheesecakes, I decided to have a commercial kitchen built in a separate area in my home as my bakery for Julie's Pies and Cheesecakes.</p>
